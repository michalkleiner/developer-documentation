# Matomo Plugin Directory Structure

Each plugin has its own directory within the root `plugins/` directory. Generally, plugins have a similar [structure as the Matomo core](/guides/how-piwik-works) for most things. Most plugins have only few files, while some others have more files. Below is a list of some files and directories that may exist in a plugin.


| File / Directory             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
